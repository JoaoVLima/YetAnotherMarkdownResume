###### Dear Hiring Manager,

```{=latex}

I am writing to express my interest in a Senior Technology / Innovation role at DC Entertainment.
As an engineer, inventor, and problem-solver with extensive experience in advanced technologies, AI systems, and aerospace engineering,
I have spent my career developing cutting-edge solutions for both civilian and high-stakes defense applications.

At Stark Industries, I led the creation of the Iron Man armor series, AI assistants such as J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y.,
and multiple clean energy projects, all designed to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
My experience managing cross-functional teams, designing complex systems, and deploying solutions at global scale
has honed my ability to deliver innovative results under pressure.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to DC’s visionary projects, whether it be interactive media,
story-driven technology, or enhancing superhero capabilities through engineering innovation.
With my expertise in AI, robotics, nanotechnology, and high-performance systems, I am confident I can bring
unique technical perspectives and creative solutions to your team.

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experience align with DC Entertainment’s initiatives,
and how I can help drive innovation at the intersection of technology and storytelling.
