###### Dear Hiring Manager,

```{=latex}

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Developer position at Google. 
With over four years of experience building scalable and reliable applications using Python and Django, 
I have developed a strong foundation in designing REST APIs, managing relational and NoSQL databases, 
and integrating complex data pipelines.

In my previous roles at Inteliger, Ravpro, and FidenTech, I have led backend projects, optimized 
PostgreSQL queries, and implemented ETL processes to support real-time reporting and strategic business decisions. 
My experience in cloud environments (AWS and GCP) and Agile teams has allowed me to deliver high-quality, maintainable 
code in collaborative settings.

I am particularly drawn to Googleâ€™s commitment to innovation and excellence in building distributed systems 
at scale. I am confident that my technical expertise in Python and Django, combined with my experience in 
system integration and data-driven applications, would allow me to contribute effectively to your engineering 
team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the Backend Developer 
role at Google. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing 
to your team.
